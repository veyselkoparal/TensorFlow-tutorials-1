    "Vectors are special types of matrices, whikch are rectangular arrays of numbers. Because vectors are ordered collections of numbers, they are often seen as column matrices: one column and a certain number of rows. You can also consider vectors as scalar magnitudes that have been given a direction. Linear vectors have a **length** and a **direction**.\n",
